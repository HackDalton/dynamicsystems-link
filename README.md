# HackDalton: DynamicSystems Link
This problem was written by [Alex Studer](https://alex.studer.dev), a guest problem writer.

## Problem:
You've been trying to get into the servers of _DynamicSystems_, a company that...well, no one really seems to know what they do.

You've discovered that their employees connect to a _link server_ and download some secret information from there, which DynamicSystems refers to as a "flag".

Luckily, you managed to find a copy of a [document describing how to communicate with their link server](./protocol.pdf). You also found a copy of the link server's source code, though you don't think it'll be very helpful.

Oh, and one more thing. Don't forget the official motto of DynamicSystems: "Since 2014: Our hearts _bleed_ for our clients!"
